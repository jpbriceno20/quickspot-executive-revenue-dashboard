# Executive Revenue Dashboard — QuickSpot

![Executive Overview](screenshots/page_01_executive_overview.png)

## Project Overview
This project delivers an executive-level revenue analytics dashboard designed to move beyond static reporting and enable **prioritized, decision-ready insights**.

The dashboard is structured in analytical layers, progressing from a high-level overview to detailed analysis across products, customers, and geographies.

## Why this exists
QuickSpot has revenue data available, but leadership lacks a clear way to quickly answer:
- What is driving revenue growth?
- Which products truly matter?
- Which customer segments sustain the business?
- Where revenue is geographically concentrated?

## Dashboard Pages

### 1) Executive Revenue Overview
High-level snapshot with YoY comparison, monthly trends, category contribution, and revenue/cost/profit structure.
