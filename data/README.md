# Data Notes

This project uses simulated retail transactional data to support revenue analysis across products, customers, geographies, and time.

## Included in this repository
Raw data files are not included to keep the repository portfolio-focused and avoid unnecessary data dumps.

## Expected structure (for the model)
The dashboard follows a star schema pattern:
- **Fact table:** Sales / Orders (transaction-level revenue and cost)
- **Dimensions:** Date, Product, Customer, Geography

## Privacy
No confidential or proprietary company data is included.
