# Project Context

Quick Spot is a multi-channel retail company operating across the United States with a diverse product portfolio and a broad customer base.

As the business grew, leadership needed a clear and structured way to understand revenue performance **beyond isolated reports**, enabling both a high-level view and deeper analysis when required.

This project was developed to provide an **executive-level revenue dashboard** that connects overall performance with detailed insights across products, customers, and geographies.

The objective is to support **prioritized, data-driven financial decisions** by helping stakeholders quickly identify where the business is performing well and where attention is required.
